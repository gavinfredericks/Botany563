# Alignment Homework

**Instructions:**

1. Read the [Alignathon](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/12/2077) paper for more information on how to select a MSA method
2. Choose the alignment method that you like the best on your project dataset (from the Alignathon paper or from the three we saw in class)
  - Note: for this HW, you only need to run one MSA method, but for your final project, you are expected to run at least two to compare the results
  - Don't forget to include in your reproducible script a short description of the chosen algorithm, its assumptions and limitations (see the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md))
3. Make sure to keep notes in your reproducible script and keep the most updated version on github (it is important to push your work to github since this allows me to check what you are doing and offer suggestions)
4. Submit the link to your github commit in canvas

**Note:** You do not need to have the output of the aligning to submit the HW, only need the commands you used.
