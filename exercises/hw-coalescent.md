# Coalescent HW

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a coalescent method that you like the best on your project dataset. If your dataset does not contain multiple genes/markers, you can do this example with the toy dataset provided by the software. 
  - Don't forget to include in your reproducible script a short description of the chosen algorithm, its assumptions and limitations (see the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md))
2. Make sure to keep notes in your reproducible script and keep the most updated version on github (it is important to push your work to github since this allows me to check what you are doing and offer suggestions)
3. Submit the link to your github commit in canvas


**Note:** You do not need to have the output to submit the HW, only need the commands you used.
