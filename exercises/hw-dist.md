# Distance and Parsimony HW

**Instructions:**

1. Estimate a distance-based tree and a parsimony-based tree for your data using the `ape` and `phangorn` R packages.
  - Don't forget to include in your reproducible script a short description of the chosen algorithm, its assumptions and limitations (see the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md))
2. Make sure to keep notes in your reproducible script and keep the most updated version on github (it is important to push your work to github since this allows me to check what you are doing and offer suggestions)
3. Submit the link to your github commit in canvas
