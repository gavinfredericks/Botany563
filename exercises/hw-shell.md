# Shell Assessment

**Objective:** Learn the shell basics that are crucial skills for phylogenetic analyses.

**Instructions:** 

- If you have used the terminal before, go ahead and simply go over the canvas quiz
- If you have never used the terminal before, then before attempting the quiz, watch [this 14-minute YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)


**Learn more:** Learning to use the terminal is a valuable skill for phylogenetics (and bioinformatics in general). We do not have time to go over the shell in class. Everybody should study these [shell notes](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and consider taking a bioinformatics class like BMI/CS 576 or STAT 679 to learn more.
