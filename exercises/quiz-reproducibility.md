# Quiz on Reproducibility 

**Objective:** Checkpoint to determine if you are comfortable with the reproducibility skills needed for the class.

**Time:** 15-20 minutes.

**Instructions:** 

We will use the same repo as in the in-class exercise [phylo-class-social](https://github.com/crsl4/phylo-class-social). You can use the class notes and google's help to solve this quiz, but you cannot talk to other students.

1. Make sure that your local repository is updated with `upstream`.
2. Create a new file called `YOURFIRSTNAME.md` (e.g. for me, it would be `claudia.md`) in your local repository.
3. Write in this file the line "This file is for the reproducibility quiz".
4. Do git add, git commit and git push to your github repository.
5. Do a pull request (recall this is done on github, not the terminal).


**Important:** The point of this quiz is for you to realize if you need to do more studying at home to be comfortable with the terminal and git/github. If you are still struggling with the terminal and/or git/github, please check out the resources at the end of the [Reproducibility notes](https://crsl4.github.io/phylogenetics-class/lecture-notes/lecture3.html).
