# Maximum Likelihood (Part 2: paper discussion)

### Previous class check-up
- We studied the algorithms for maximum likelihood and focused on the main contributors to good or poor performance

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- explain in details the RAxML and IQ-Tree inference methods
- use RAxML and IQ-Tree software


### Pre-class work

- Read the papers corresponding to your group (in canvas):
  - [RAxML1](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/9/1312/238053?login=true)
  - [RAxML2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/21/4453/5487384?login=true)
  - [IQ-Tree1](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/1/268/2925592?login=true)
  - [IQ-Tree2](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/5/1530/5721363?login=true)



# In-class discussion

**Objective:** Understand the main algorithms, assumptions and limitations of two widely used maximum likelihood software.

**Instructions:**

1. Separate group discussions (30 minutes): Students will discuss with their respective groups and prepare a 10-minute presentation for the whole class. Use the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md) as guideline for your discussion and presentation. Use these google slides:
  - [RAxML](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zJ2fJpWHywxnuIdVbwzkPAT7ZgTp9q5a3oUO31doYXM/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [IQ-Tree](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YL_ds1n1dcaY-k8ybMjtLyjVNa1sG6qV6qxBhlKl0RM/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Group presentations (20 minutes total; 10 minutes per group): Each group will summarize their discussion in a 10-minute presentation to the class.

{: .important }
**Take-home message:** always read carefully the paper and the documentation of any phylogenetic method you use

{: .note }
Create your own [cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md) with description, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions and user choices (and other things you find relevant).
