# Bayesian Inference (Part 2: paper discussion)

### Previous class check-up
- We studied Bayesian inference and focused on the main contributors to good or poor performance: priors, convergence and burnin.

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- explain in details the MrBayes inference methods
- use MrBayes software


### Pre-class work

- Read the papers corresponding to your group (in canvas):
  - [MrBayes1](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/17/8/754/235132) and [MrBayes2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/12/1572/257621)
  - [RevBayes](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/65/4/726/1753608)



# In-class discussion

**Objective:** Understand the method, assumptions and limitations of MrBayes software and Bayesian phylogenetics.

**Instructions:**

1. Separate group discussions (30 minutes): Students will discuss with their respective groups and prepare a 10-minute presentation for the whole class. Use the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md) as guideline for your discussion and presentation. Use these google slides:
  - [MrBayes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wzYCyDc8sGdraFdt5betLvH4H8XMI_xiMYFBjnIMs1k/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [RevBayes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fv2JmwXL2B2H2rr4P_3jbbTMPN5F_lD_-WqJEDUfPrg/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Group presentations (20 minutes total; 10 minutes per group): Each group will summarize their discussion in a 10-minute presentation to the class.


{: .important }
**Take-home message:** always read carefully the paper and the documentation of any phylogenetic method you use

{: .note }
Create your own [cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md) with description, strengths, weaknesses, assumptions and user choices (and other things you find relevant).
