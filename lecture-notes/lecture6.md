# Filtering alignments (HAL 2.2)

- MSA is messy and error-prone, so many times we need to filter out poorly aligned regions
- We need to make sure that we do not remove signal along with the noise
- The balance depends on the planned downstream analysis: 
  - Example: misaligned regions impacting a single sequence at one time will have little impact on the phylogeny inference apart from terminal branch length estimations, but they will induce many false positives when searching for loci under positive selection
- For reproducibility reasons, we want automatic MSA cleaning methods, not manual, but there are no options yet
- Two types of filtering methods:
    - (take it or leave it) TILI-filtering methods: remove whole sites or whole sequences
    - masking residues: replace by gap or a symbol representing ambiguity ?,N,X (picky-filtering methods)

### What are the problematic regions of an aligment?

1. poorly informative
  - patchy: too many gaps (Fig 8a HAL)
  - regions in the vicinity of patchy regions (Fig 8b HAL)

2. wrongly aligned
  - misaligned regions (Fig 8c HAL)
  - low complexity regions with repeated characteristics (Fig 8d HAL)

### What causes problematic MSA regions?
- Highly divergent or non-homologous sequence fragments
    - Note that even when sequences are too divergent, or not even homologous, MSA software will still produce an alignment
    - Somewhere along the gradient from highly similar sequences to highly divergent sequences,
there is a critical point beyond which to align sequences is not possible, or biologically
meaningful: too many substitutions or indels have occurred

- High-throughput sequencing or annotation errors 
    - Sequencing errors -> small indels in nucleotide alignments -> errors in translation
    - Errors in homology annotation can lead to the inclusion of sequences that are not homologous
    - All sequences are homologous but some are erroneously considered as being
orthologous (derived from ancestral copy by speciation) while actually being paralogous
(derived from ancestral copy by duplication)

### Principles underlying filtering methods

- Gaps indicate hard to align and possibly saturated regions 
    - From a biological viewpoint, it is often assumed that in proteins insertions and deletions are less frequent than point substitutions

- Few/similar residues are expected per site
- Reliable regions are likely more robust to MSA method variations

- Homologous (fragment of) sequences are expected to be similar (pre-filtering)
    - For most pipelines, sequence similarity is an initial criterion used to identify homologous sequences

### TILI-filtering methods vs masking residues methods

![](../assets/pics/fig9hal.png)

- TILI-filtering methods are fated to remove signals along with noise
- TILI-filtering methods could still do a great job regarding phylogeny inference if they are able to correctly identify and remove sequences and sites containing more noise than signal
- In general, masking residues methods are better

# Orthology detection (HAL 2.4)

## Homology subtypes

- All life on earth shares a common origin
- Homologous genes: share ancestry
- We want to distinguish more precisely how homologous genes are related, giving rise to different homology subtypes
  - orthologs: speciation
  - paralogs: duplication
  - ohnologs: whole genome duplication
  - homoelogs: hybridization
  - xenologs: lateral gene transfer
- We mostly focus on orthologs due to their importance in phylogenomics
- Orthology can be a one-to-one relationship, a one-to-many, or many-to-one relationship
- Orthology and paralogy relationships are not transitive (see next figure)

# Orthologous groups: Figure summary

- Orthology can be a one-to-one, a one-to-many, a many-to-one, or many-to-many relationship
  - Example: a mammal gene in the human lineage and duplicated in the rodent lineage. Both rodent paralogous copies are orthologous to the human gene
- Orthology and paralogy relationships are not transitive
  - Example: mouse has two insulin genes Ins1 and Ins2, which duplicated within the rodent lineage. Human has one copy, INS. Therefore, Ins1 is orthologous to INS, INS is orthologous to Ins2, but Ins1 is not orthologous but paralogous to Ins2
- There are different types of orthologous groups: strict ortholog groups (transitive) and hierarchical orthologs groups
- Hierarchical orthogroups are obtained by the speciation nodes on the reconciled gene trees
  - "Reconciled gene trees": internal nodes labelled as speciation or duplication (HAL 3.2)
- Here, we will not worry on the reconciliation step and will focus on identifying and using orthologs

# Orthology inference methods

### Bidirectional Best Hit (BBH)
- Also found as "reciprocal best hit"
- Call as orthologs all pairs of genes between two species that are more similar (i.e., with highest alignment score) to one another than to any other gene in the other species
- In BLAST: gene _i_ in genome _I_ is BBH of gene _j_ in genome _J_ if query of genome _I_ with gene _j_ hits gene _i_ and viceversa
- Learn more:
  - Original paper: [Overbeek et al 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC15866/)
  - Bidirectional Best Hits miss many orthologs in duplication-rich clades such as plants and animals [Dalquen & Dessimoz, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3814191/)

# Orthology inference methods

### Reciprocal Smallest Distance (RSD)

- It relies on global sequence alignment and maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary distances to detect orthologs between two genomes
- Original paper [Wall et al, 2003](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/19/13/1710/224944)
- Steps:
  1. You have gene _i_ from genome _I_ and target genome _J_
  2. With BLAST, identify a set of hits _H_ above a predefined significance threshold
  3. Use ClustalW to pairwise align every sequence in _H_ with gene _i_
  4. If the alignment score is greater than a threshold, the sequence _h_ is kept (call this set of hits _H2_)
  5. Using PAML, you calculate the maximum likelihood evolutionary distance between every sequence in _H2_ and gene _i_ based on a given model of evolution
  6. The sequence with the minimim evolutionary distance to gene _i_ is identified as the ortholog

# Orthology inference methods

### Tree-based methods
- Tree-based orthology inference methods
reconstruct a gene tree for a group of homologous sequences to then infer the type of
evolutionary event represented by each internal node of the tree
- To label the trees, there are two options:
  - gene tree/species tree reconciliation methods (HAL 3.2)
  - species overlap: duplication nodes have the same species represented in child subtrees
- Software: 
  - PANTHER, GIGA, EmsembleCompara use reconciliation approach
  - PhylomeDB, MetaPhOrs, ETE library use the species overlap approach

# Orthology inference methods

### Graph-based methods
- Avoid inferring trees and instead
compare sequences in a pairwise fashion, and build a graph with genes as nodes and some
measure of sequence similarity as edges
- Assumption: orthologs tend to be the pairs of sequences that have diverged the least
- Rely on computational approaches to identify clusters in the graph to be considered the orthologous groups
- Software: Inparanoid, OMA, OrthoMCL, OrthoFinder, OrthoInspector, QuartetS

# Impact on phylogenomics inference

- Initially, there was no need to search for orthologs
  - The experimental design in molecular phylogenetics included the identification
of highly conserved regions in the organismal lineage of interest, that were amplified by PCR. As the same marker gene
 (i.e. the orthologous gene) was specifically sequenced from each of the species of interest,
there was no need to search for orthologs

- High-throughput sequencing and the availability of complete (or nearly complete)
genomes and transcriptomes allow us in principle to choose among virtually any marker gene.
In these cases, there is a need of inferring orthologous genes from the source genomic datasets

- Few studies have compared how sets of orthologs inferred through different methods vary and how it
affects species tree reconstruction, but see [Dalquen et al 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056925) and [Nichio et al 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2017.00165/full)
